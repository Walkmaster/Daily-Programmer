        <h3>The Challenge: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/38yy9s/20150608_challenge_218_easy_making_numbers/">Palindrome Number</a></h3>
        <p>To covert nearly any number into a palindromic number you operate by reversing the digits and adding and then repeating the steps until you get a palindromic number. Some require many steps.</p>

        <p>e.g. 24 gets palindromic after 1 steps: 66 -&gt; 24 + 42 = 66</p>

        <p>while 28 gets palindromic after 2 steps: 121 -&gt; 28 + 82 = 110, so 110 + 11 (110 reversed) = 121.</p>

        <p>Note that, as an example, 196 never gets palindromic (at least according to researchers, at least never in reasonable time). Several numbers never appear to approach being palindromic.</p>

        <p>You will describe how many steps it took to get it to be palindromic, and what the resulting palindrome is. Example:</p>

        <p>Bonus: see which input numbers, through 1000, yield identical palindromes. </p>

        <p>Bonus 2: See which numbers don&#39;t get palindromic in under 10000 steps. Numbers that never converge are called Lychrel numbers. </p>
